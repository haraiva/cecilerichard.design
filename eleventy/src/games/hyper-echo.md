*HYPER//ECHO* was a web-based “zone”, an online multiple game where players were invited to explore this virtual space, and leave something behind — buildings and messages for other players to discover. Over the course of the 3-month exhibition, these structures gradually decayed; buildings became overgrown ruins, messages became unreadable.

The game was commissioned by ACMI for the online gallery space Gallery 5, and playable from April 3rd to July 1st 2022.

The artist's statement I wrote for HYPER//ECHO:

> “You’ve had an experience like this before.  
<br>Maybe you went to check a website you like, only to be greeted by the message: *This site can’t be reached*. Maybe you wanted to rewatch that one decade-old YouTube video that makes you laugh so much, and realised that it’s been taken down. The last time you trawled through old articles for research, each linking to other articles that no longer exist.  
<br>You look through the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, but the picture is incomplete. Images or fonts or entire pages are missing, and it’s just not like you remembered it.  
<br>Things you thought would always be there, gone overnight.  
<br>We grow disillusioned with the current state of the internet, with its algorithm-powered doomscrolls, paywalls, closed-off proprietary systems, and ad-riddled recipe sites. Meanwhile, the false promise of an  eternal, decentralised third sequel to the internet gets dangled by predatory blockchain companies as the panacea for our digital ills as they actively exacerbate the intricate exploitative systems we live within.  
<br>HYPER//ECHO points to our relationship with technology and the digital world, how brittle and ephemeral – often by design – its infrastructure really is, and to the fundamental human desire to preserve and pass down knowledge, even when buildings crumble down, languages wane, and hyperlinks break.”
