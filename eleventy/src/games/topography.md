> *All this new technology  
will eventually give us new feelings  
that will never completely displace the old ones,  
leaving everyone feeling quite nervous  
and split in two.*  
<br>— David Berman, *Self-Portrait at 28*

*TOPOGRAPHY* is a Bitsy game about online friendships, the golden age of tumblr, closeness and closure. 

It was commissioned by the Sydney-based online arts platform [Running Dog](https://rundog.art/) and released in October 2020 for the special issue [LIVE STREAM NOW](https://rundog.art/issues/live-stream-now/).
