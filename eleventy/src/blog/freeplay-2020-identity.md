title: Behind The Scenes — Freeplay 2020 Visual Identity
date: 2021-06-17

Hey folks!

This is a post detailing the process and work that went into creating the [Freeplay 2020 visual identity](link), similar to the [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/haraiva/status/1178223880160153605) that I made about the work I did for Parallels 2019. I really enjoyed writing about my process then and it seemed to be interesting/helpful/enlightening to a lot of people, especially people unfamiliar with graphic design so I thought I'd do it again!

## Brief

Just like with Parallels, it all started with Freeplay Visual Art Lead and extremely talented artist Goldie Bartlett (@GhostTownGoldie) contacting me and briefing me about the project. What's this year's Freeplay theme? What are the important things we should be expressing with these visuals? Who are we talking to?

What we established early on for this visual identity:
— the theme of Freeplay 2020 is BELONGING.
— an important element we wanted to express was the sense of community and mutual support that doesn't just stop at the Melbourne game development scene.
— as always, not using imagery that is too videogamey. Freeplay is a games festival but it also includes and displays works by visual artists, writers, comics artists...
— do NOT use the colours associated with other local game conferences such as GCAP.

I lost my notes from the phone call so this is all I remember but I don’t think there was anything else that was crucial (otherwise I probably would have remembered it…)

Once I had some basic info about the project, I had a few ideas in mind, and it was time for absorbing a lot of visual inspiration.

## Visual Research + First Drafts

![pinterest moodboard for the project](/img/fp2020/moodboard.jpg)

As you may notice in the image above, at this point I already had a specific aesthetic and general colour hues that I gravitated towards for the project: fun and abstract shapes, earthy tones, lots of green, a comfy and homely mood…

As the visuals for Parallels were very much abstract, I was leaning more towards making actual illustrations for this year’s edition of Freeplay. I think early on I had decided to essentially make sequential art as a poster. What if the visuals loosely tell a story about a person finding their community, like a very minimalistic comic? Or perhaps they could be vignettes that evoke the feelings and sensations that Freeplay is often associated with? 

I talked to Goldie about this idea and she was really encouraging! In order to keep it simple, we decided it might be best to have about 5 or 6 vignettes that we can then play around with for composition.

![early drafts including fun shapes i didn’t end up using](/img/fp2020/sketches1.jpg)

The vignettes are:
— a sunset with a house in the foreground, the feeling of comfort;
— puddles of water reflecting a city, subtly hinting at autumn in Melbourne;
— two cups of coffee, illustrating two people meeting up;
— two hands holding each other, as if one was lifting the other up;
— constellations, the connections we make during the festival;
— the house at night with a plane flying in the background, Freeplay radiating internationally.

Interestingly, this was all conceptualised back in early February before the pandemic hit and yet I think the themes and aesthetics of the visuals fit especially well as this edition of Freeplay ended up becoming a digital event that included a virtual space (the Freeplay ZONE) where people could hang out in, which seemed to be a source of comfort and connection that a lot of people needed as we all isolated during lockdown.

## Composition + Colours

It was pretty quick for us to decide on a composition that works. I decided to “connect” the vignettes with a bunch of noodly arms which immediately made the visuals a lot more playful, which is always nice when you’re designing for a games festival.

OK, we had a concept, a composition, a clean sketch… it was time to draw. I made all the illustrations in Photoshop then vectorised everything in Illustrator as it made changing colours and resizing elements a LOT easier.

Colours are always a tough one for me. As we can see on the example above I strayed away from our initial moodboard’s earthy mellow tones and instead went into lilacs and turquoise, which I wasn’t really satisfied with, especially compared to the greyscale version I was working with right until I started playing with colours. I felt the overall visuals could be much simpler. 

What if I just went with a restricted colour palette of essentially two or three colours?

The results were much more cohesive and it didn’t totally hurt to look at.

After making a few different iterations of the colours, we settled on the green/red option. 
It felt like it was standing out the most and giving that laid-back, almost nostalgic, warm vibe.

All we had to do now was to get the final approval from Festival Director Chad Toprak (@MrChad), add dates, hashtags and info, sponsor logos and adapt the visuals for digital platforms, which meant horizontal compositions. That went pretty smoothly, although I did have the thought that perhaps I should have started the early sketches with a horizontal composition as we seldom use the vertical one… old habits die hard.

## What It Ended Up Looking Like

Below is what it all ended up looking like, which may not be that much of a surprise if you’ve been to the website or attended the event. If you have not… voilà!

We even made animated gifs with some of the vignettes!

This concludes our journey through this project! 

I’m really proud of the work I made for Freeplay over the last two(ish) years. I feel incredibly fortunate to be part of a community of people in the game dev industry who work so hard to include and value games that are weird, non-commercial, and even made by creators who don’t usually make games.

As I’ve mentioned earlier in this post, looking back at these visuals a month after the online edition of Freeplay ended and as Melbourne is going through a prolonged lockdown period feels strangely bittersweet. 

While we didn’t get to have an IRL event this year, I’m also extremely proud of the work my absurdly hard-working friend Jae (@jemztones) and I made on the Freeplay ZONE which brought people together in a comfy 2D space to socialise, watch talks, dance, stay up late, catch up with each other. 

It’s super interesting to me that the work I did for the Freeplay visual identity and the art I made for the ZONE somewhat mirror each other in that they both come from my own reminiscing of what Freeplay represents to me. You can see it in the puddles reflecting city lights, you can see it in the myriads of pixelated fairy lights, and it’s all tinted with a bit of wistful nostalgia.

If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading!
