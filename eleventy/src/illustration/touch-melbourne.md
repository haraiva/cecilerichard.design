*TOUCH MELBOURNE* is a short game in which the player explores the city of Melbourne through its various, tiny everyday interactions. This game was made with Andrew Gleeson during the [RMIT Blue Light Collective](https://rmitlink.rmit.edu.au/Clubs/bluelightcollective) Game Jam in June 2018.

The art style for this game is a direct adaptation of the simple lineart-and-halftone style from my comics around that time.

→ You can [download TOUCH MELBOURNE on itch.io](https://gleeson.itch.io/touchmelbourne).
- Instructions: Use mouse to interact.
- Playtime: 10–15min
